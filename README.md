# portfolio

My portfolio website!

I am building this with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without any frameworks, or CMS templates. In doing so, I am hoping to show that I have strong foundational skills in these languages.

## Goals

What I want from my portfolio website:
- One-page layout
- Snappy user experience
    - Smooth and responsive animations, used appropriately
    - Minimal lag
    - Automatic dark mode + manual light/dark mode setting
- Classy design
    - I want this website to stand out without trying to do too much
    - It should have a spin that is "uniquely me"
    - It should still be a pleasant viewing experience
