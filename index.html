                    <p>I did this website for my client, the developer of the game Amberial Dreams. Initially I was asked to implement an interface that displayed the game's featured levels, sourced from mod.io's REST API. However, I also offered to give the existing website an overall facelift, to bring it more in line with modern web trends.</p>

                    <p>When the new year rolled around, I was thinking about timezone differences around the world and realised that I could build something to help me easily visualise this.</p>
                    <p>I also used this as an opportunity to learn React (and introduce myself to Netlify), which I really enjoyed.</p>

                    <p>After looking at a lot of web portfolios, I noticed that a lot of them used full-page hero sections and my hands got tired of scrolling after a little while! So I wanted my portfolio website to be more of an "expandable business card".</p>
                    <p>This website features a parallax scrolling background, automatic dark mode detection and manual theme selection (your choice is remembered if you refresh).</p>
                    <p>I decided not to incorporate any frameworks because I wanted to have a project that displayed my understanding of the foundations. </p>

        <section class="about">
            <p>If you're thinking of bringing me on board, here's what you need to know.</p>
            <h3>As a person</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm a game-artist-turned-frontend-developer with a honed eye for detail and an insatiable desire to expand my skillset</li>
                <li>I take my work very seriously, but I don't take myself seriously - I always try to bring a positive vibe to whatever team environment I'm in</li>
                <li>I'm a fast learner and I don't mind learning from my own mistakes, because I believe failure is a great teacher</li>
                <li>Similarly, I approach others with a constructive and encouraging attitude, and I'm always happy to share knowledge when it's needed</li>
                <li>I'm not afraid to push out of my comfort zone - I enjoy the struggle of learning new concepts because I know that persistence is rewarded</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>In the workplace</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I've developed a strong set of soft skills after a few years of freelancing in the indie games industry (both as an artist and a developer)</li>
                <li>I have a lot of experience working with various development teams and communicating with team leads, clients and colleagues</li>
                <li>I have worked on projects from inception, taken projects to the finish line, and worked on ongoing projects with existing codebases</li>
                <li>I'm very willing to adapt to other people's work practices and communication styles</li>
                <li>I hold my work to a high standard, but I'm practical enough to understand the diminishing returns of pursuing perfection (and scope creep)</li>
                <li>I've worked in demanding environments with short deadlines and limited budgets</li>
                <li>Having fallen in love with web development, I look forward to bringing these skills to meet challenges within a programming context</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My resume is available on request. Have a nice day!</p>
