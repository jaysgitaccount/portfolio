                        <p>After looking at a lot of web portfolios, I noticed that a lot of them used full-page hero sections and my hands got tired of scrolling after a little while! So I wanted my portfolio website to be more of an "expandable business card".</p>
                        <p>I decided not to incorporate any frameworks because I wanted to have a project that displayed my understanding of the foundations. </p>

                        <p>A website that I did for a client. Initially I was asked to implement an interface that displayed the game's featured levels, sourced from mod.io's REST API. However, I also offered to give the existing website an overall facelift, to bring it more in line with modern web trends.</p>

            <p>If you're thinking of bringing me on board, here's what you need to know.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm an artist-turned-developer with a honed eye for details</li>
                <li>After a few years of freelancing in the indie games industry (both as an artist and a developer), I've developed a strong set of soft skills</li>
                <li>I have a lot of experience working with various development teams and communicating with all kinds of people</li>
                <li>I'm naturally inquisitive and highly motivated to constantly improve my skills</li>
                <li>I'm a fast learner and I don't mind learning from my own mistakes, because I believe failure is a great teacher</li>
                <li>Similarly, I approach coworkers and clients with a constructive and encouraging attitude, and I'm always happy to share knowledge when it's needed</li>
                <li>I'm not afraid of pushing out of my comfort zone - I enjoy the struggle of learning new concepts because I know that persistence is rewarded</li>
                <li>I have experience working on projects from inception, as well as working on existing codebases and adapting to other people's work practices</li>
                <li>I hold my work to a high standard, but I understand the diminishing returns of pursuing perfection (and scope creep)</li>
                <li>As a result, I also have experience finishing projects that have been started</li>
                <li>I've done work in demanding environments with short deadlines and limited budgets</li>
                <li>I take my work very seriously, but I don't take myself seriously - I always try to bring a positive vibe to whatever team environment I'm in</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My resume is available on request. Have a nice day!</p>
